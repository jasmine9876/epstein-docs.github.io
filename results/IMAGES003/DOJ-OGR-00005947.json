E. Bicanic1*, Lieve M. Hehenkamp1, Elise M. van de Putte2, Arjen J. van Wijk3 and Ad de Jongh3,4\n1National Psychotrauma Center for Children and Youth, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht The Netherlands; 2Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 3Department of Behavioral Sciences, ACTA, University of Amsterdam and VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 4School of Health Sciences, Salford University, Manchester, United Kingdom\nBackground: Delayed disclosure of rape has been associated with impaired mental health; it is, therefore, important to understand which factors are associated with disclosure latency. The purpose of this study was to compare various demographics, post-rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers (i.e., more than 1 week post-rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323 help-seeking female adolescents and young adults (12-25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no reported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within 1 week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical services and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed and early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of age category 12-17 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, confidence intervals (CI) 1.13-3.73], penetration (OR 2.36, CI 1.25-4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI 1.52-4.60) contributed significantly to the prediction of delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to disclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; posttraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaett Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

There is evidence to suggest that victims believe that professionals will not be helpful to them because their rape experience does not match stereotypical conceptions of rape, such as involving a stranger, a weapon, and severe injury (Patterson, Greeson, & Campbell, 2009; Resnick et al., 2000). Accordingly, adolescents and young adults, who are more at risk to be victimized by rape than other age groups (De Haas, Van Berlo, Bakker, & Vanwesenbeeck, 2012; Tjaden & Thoennes, 2006), may not report the crime to the police (Ruch, Coyne, & Perrone, 2000).\nFor reasons of mental health and public safety, it is important to understand the potential factors that are related to disclosure. Timing of disclosure may be a crucial factor, as early disclosers are more likely to utilize appropriate medical care and report to the police than delayed disclosers (Ahrens, Stansell, & Jennings, 2010; Ullman & Filipas, 2001). In contrast, adults who wait longer than 1 month to disclose the rape are more likely to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression compared to early disclosers (Ruggiero et al., 2004).\nEuropean Journal of Psychotraumatology 2015. © 2015 Iva A.
