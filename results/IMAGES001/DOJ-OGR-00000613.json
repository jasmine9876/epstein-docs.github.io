MOE: Yes, your Honor. 10 We have conferred with defense counsel and talked 11 about a proposed schedule for this case. So we are prepared to 12 propose to the court today a schedule for discovery, for 13 discovery-related motions, for pretrial motions, and we are 14 also prepared to talk about setting a possible trial date. 15 THE COURT: Okay. What have you got in mind? 16 MS. MOE: So, with respect to discovery, we would 17 propose a discovery deadline of October 31 to complete 18 discovery, with one exception. There are materials from 19 devices seized from the defendant's residence in New York, and 20 the F.B.I. is beginning the process of reviewing that data. 21 In discussing that with defense counsel, we have begun 22 to discuss a process for a privilege-review protocol. It's 23 possible that process may take longer than October 31. But 24 aside from that universe of documents, we would propose setting 25 a schedule of October 31 as a deadline for discovery.
