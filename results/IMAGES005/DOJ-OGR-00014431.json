She said, 2 Disclosure is a process that unfolds over time. So individuals 3 will typically begin the disclosure maybe by alluding to what's 4 happened in a general sense or the gist of what's happened. 5 Let me pause here and say that's exactly what happened 6 with Matt. She's alluding to what happened, giving the gist of 7 it, but not all the details. It's just too hard. 8 Here's the rest of her testimony. And then it's only 9 over time they will begin to talk more specifically about what 10 has happened. And even in therapy, oftentimes disclosure of 11 the most intimate or difficult details is something that's very 12 hard and individuals are very reluctant to do. Dr. Rocchio has 13 explained to you that's what happens in these cases, and she's 14 an expert in the psychology of sexual trauma. 15 Now, the defense cross-examined Jane about why she 16 didn't immediately tell someone about the abuse she suffered 17 when she was 14 and 15 and 16, as if that would have been easy. 18 And, in fact, when the defense points out that Jane wasn't able 19 to tell people what really happened to her, they're actually 20 pointing to what makes this a textbook case of child sexual 21 abuse. 22 How else do you know that Jane told you the truth? 23 It's because her testimony is corroborated by the testimony of 24 Annie and Carolyn and Kate, whose experiences were strikingly 25 similar, as we've already discussed. It's not a coincidence. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014431",
